<h3>Project Introduction</h3>
	It has been several months since the COVID-19 pandemic began its rapid spread across the globe. There has been high variability in the types of responses taken by local and national leadership in attempts to react to the virus with differing degrees of success. For this project we narrow our focus to the situation in the United States as we investigate the effect of the political parties of State Governors and of state closure decisions on each state’s COVID-19 outcomes. 


<h3>Research Question</h3>
<ul><li>What is the impact of the State Governor’s Political Party in addressing Covid-19 pandemic?</li></ul>

<h3>Approach:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Data understanding and EDA</b></li>
<li><b>Date Preparation:</b>
We combined several publicly-available data sets.</li>  
<li><b>Machine Learning (if applicable - supervised, unsupervised):</b>
We plan to develop predictive models that will use the party affiliation of a state’s governor as well as certain closure decisions to predict current hospitalization rate, deaths/million and cases/million. We intend to control for factors such as state GDP, household income, population, and large city count.</li>
<li><b>Evaluation:</b></li>  	  	
</ol>

<h3>Known Issues (problems with predictors, reporting, bias, etc.)</h3>
<p>One issue might be that there is not necessarily uniformity in how states report testing, deaths, hospitalizations, and confirmed cases. So this must be kept in mind when comparing numbers between the states.</p>
 
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This is where the conclusion will go</p>
